# Steps for Creating a Blog Website and Fetching Data from an API

## Step 1: Fetch Data from an API

First, we need to create a function that fetches data from an API.

```javascript
//const response = await fetch("url"); // Use the API URL from where you fetch the data.



  The function is asynchronous (async) because fetching data from an API takes time.
  Use try and catch to handle any potential errors that might occur during the fetch process.
  In the try block, the function attempts to fetch the data. If it fails, the error is caught in the catch block.

try {
  const data = await fetchData();
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error or throw it further
  console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
}


# Code Reference
You can find the complete code for this step on the following GitHub repository:

The fetchData function is already created in the file page.tsx under the blog directory.
You can refer to the comment section for detailed steps.


# Step 2: Use React Hook useEffect for Fetching Data
Next, implement the useEffect hook for fetching data when the component is loaded.

useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);  // Empty dependency array means it runs once after the initial render.


# Explanation
useEffect is a React hook that lets you perform side effects in your component.
In this case, it is used to fetch data from the API once the component mounts.
The empty dependency array [] ensures that this effect runs only once when the component is first rendered.
Tip: You can also reload the fetched data based on certain dependencies or state changes.

# Step 3: Using useState to Manage Fetched Data
To handle the fetched data, we'll use Reactâ€™s useState hook to store and manage it.

const [getData, setGetData] = useState([]);


# Explanation
useState is used to store the data returned from the API.
The getData state variable will hold the fetched data.
setGetData is the function to update the state when new data is fetched.

Use the following pattern to assign the fetched data to state:
setGetData(data);  // Assign the fetched data to the `getData` state.
You can then access getData to show the fetched data in your component.
